### kenken Solver
## Overview
Kenken is an arithmetic and logic puzzle, somewhat similar to Sudoku. It was created by Tetsuya Miyamoto, a Japanese math teacher, in 2004.
A puzzle consists of an n /times n grid, typically ranging from 3 /times 3 to 9 /times 9. Just as in Sudoku, no number can be repeated in a row or
column. Unlike the 3 /times 3 boxes in Sudoku, boxes in KenKen are of variable size and contain a target number as well as a mathematical operator.
Applying the operator to the numbers in the box must yield the target.
